## Project Overview
This project offers a real-time solution for body measurement using advanced pose estimation techniques and deep learning. It leverages the power of MediaPipe and OpenCV to accurately measure various body parts such as hips, shoulders, upper body. This tool can be used in various domains including fitness, fashion, and health monitoring.

## Features
- Real-time capturing of body measurements using a webcam.
- Utilization of MediaPipe for accurate pose estimation.
- Calculation of distances between various body landmarks.
- Support for multiple persons' measurements.
- Data storage for both input and calculated measurements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- A webcam or a video input device



## How It Works
- The application captures video from a webcam and uses MediaPipe's pose estimation to identify body landmarks.
- Measurements between specific landmarks (hips, shoulders, etc.) are calculated.
- Users are prompted to input real measurements for comparison purposes.
- Data is saved in a local folder for further analysis.
